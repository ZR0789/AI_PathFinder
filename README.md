AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Algorithm Visualizer

AI Pathfinder is a grid-based visualization tool built using Python and Pygame to demonstrate how classic uninformed search algorithms explore a problem space.
The project focuses on visual learning, allowing users to observe frontier expansion, explored nodes, and final path construction step by step.

This tool was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence coursework project to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical intuition.

 Features
Interactive 10×10 grid environment
Real-time animation of search behavior
Clear visual distinction between:
Start node
Goal node
Walls/obstacles
Explored nodes
Frontier nodes
Final solution path
Keyboard-controlled algorithm selection
Execution visualization with adjustable speed

Implemented Algorithms
The system visualizes the following uninformed search algorithms:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
Bidirectional Search

Each algorithm demonstrates its unique exploration strategy in the same grid environment for easy comparison.
